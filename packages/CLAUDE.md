# Packages

## Utilities

Use `es-toolkit` for common operations (isEqual, cloneDeep, debounce, etc).

## TypeScript

Avoid type assertions (`as`, `any`, `as unknown as`). Omit return types when inference is sufficient.

When a type error occurs, analyze why the types don't match and fix the type definitions or logic accordingly.
